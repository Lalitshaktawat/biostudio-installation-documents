# **Introduction**

**BioStudio** offers curated, ready-to-run notebooks, multi-omics data, and specialized applications designed specifically for bioinformaticians.

## **Overview**

**BioStudio** is a powerful tool from **BioTuring** that enables scientists to analyze biomedical data in a customizable way. With its numerous features and ready-to-use notebooks, users can easily execute and explore their data.

**BioStudio** offers a variety of tools to help users post their data and analyze the reports. It supports various scientific programming languages such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://go.dev/">Golang</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://octave.org/">GNU Octave</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, making it ideal for data analysis and education.

Technically, **BioStudio** is a hosted Jupyter Notebook service that requires no setup, allowing users to quickly build their own notebooks based on their requirements.

## **Features**

### Notebook:

- **BioStudio** provides many **ready-to-use** notebooks with fully pre-installed environments and executable codes. You just need to download an interesting notebook and run on either example datasets or your own data with a simple click.

- The notebooks are updated frequently with the latest methods, algorithms, and pipelines, coming with clear instructions and interpretation of example results.

### Package:

- **BioStudio** provides pre-prepared library packages, saving users time and effort required for installation.

- Users can easily create and manage Conda environments using these packages.

- **BioStudio** also supports users in creating notebook kernels from their Conda environments.

### Study:

- The BioTuring database currently contains more than 100 million cells from thousands of publications with comprehensive annotation, stringent quality control, and continuous growth.

- The database contains various multi-omics such as bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, spatial-omics, etc.

- Once logged in, users can easily search for their desired study and clone the data for further analysis.

### Application:

- **BioStudio** provides researchers with many interpretative tools for data manipulation in **BioStudio** workspace such as Shiny apps, Visualization apps, etc. These tools are designed to help researchers easily analyze and interpret their data.

- Additionally, BioStudio integrates several open-source applications, including Shiny Server, VScode, and File Browsers, into its workspace for enhanced functionality.

## **Installation**

BioStudio provides 2 ways to install:

### On private server.

- It is installed and runs on computers on the premises of the person or organization using the software, rather than at a remote facility such as a server farm or cloud.

- For more details, checkout this link: <a target="_blank" href="https://studio.bioturing.com/document/installation">Installation Steps</a>

### On BioTuring cloud.

- It is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user.
