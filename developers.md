</br>
</br>

- **Table of contents**: shows the structure of a document and allows users to navigate to specific sections by clicking on entries in the sidebar. It is automatically generated when working with notebooks, markdown, or python files and each listed section will be hyperlinked to the actual section within your document.
  </br>

  Automatic section numbering feature is designed to number your notebook's sections and subsections based on your headings. This means that if you move any major sections around multiple times, you do not need to manually renumber the document and its subsections.

</br>
</br>

If a notebook section has runnable code cells, a context menu is added to the corresponding table of contents heading. Clicking the "Run Cell(s)" option in the top menu bar will execute those code cells in the notebook.
